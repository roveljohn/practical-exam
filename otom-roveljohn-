Summary: PHP Data Structures and Book Management System
 
This system provides three distinct methods for managing and accessing book data, each using different programming approaches for optimal performance.
 
1. Recursive Category Display
​
- Functionality: Processes nested book categories through self-calling functions.
​
- Features:
​
- Dynamically adjusts indentation to visualize hierarchy depth.
​
- Handles unlimited subcategory levels without manual configuration.
​
- Example:
 
 
​
2. Hash Table Data Retrieval
​
- Functionality: Implements associative arrays for O(1) access time.
​
- Features:
​
- Maps book titles directly to metadata collections.
​
- Provides immediate fail-safes for missing entries.
​
- Example:
 
 
​
3. Binary Search Tree Operations
​
- Functionality: Maintains sorted order through tree structure properties.
​
- Features:
​
- Enables efficient search operations with O(log n) complexity.
​
- Automatically outputs elements in sorted sequence via inorder traversal.
​
- Example:
 
 
 
This system combines data structures like recursion, hash tables, and binary search trees, aiming to provide an efficient, flexible, and reliable solution for book data management..
